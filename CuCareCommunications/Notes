Changes:
-Using QJson now, because we realized we couldn't do what we wanted to with Qt's regular stuff.

-New "tableName" parameter in ClientNetworkInterface, as I didn't realize that was required in comms.

-Several classes in Communications are now abstract where they weren't before. They are now abstract because they have only static member functions (utilities used to convert stuff into other stuff in comms).


Things to think about:
-What happens to a server exception that happens in a signalled slot? Is this even possible?
